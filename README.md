# PS-Export-Groups-Jpeg
Export Photoshop groups as individual JPEG images, with adjustable settings. Based on http://www.damienvanholten.com/blog/export-groups-to-files-photoshop/

To use:

* Save the .jsx file to your computer
* In Photoshop, go to File > Scripts > Browse...
* Locate the .jsx file and run it

By default, each group is saved as a 60% quality JPEG, without a color profile, and unoptopimized. Each file will have the name of the layer group and be saved in the save directory of the .PSD file.
